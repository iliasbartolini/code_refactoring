Code Refactoring
================

Step by step exercises to introduce the practice of Refactoring.


## How to use this codebase

You should probably have followed a introductory presentation to code refactoring.<br>
See on [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/brain79/code-refactoring-workshop-in-javascript)

Prerequisite is basic knowledge of Javascript and have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. 


Setup the codebase

```
$ npm install
```

Run code linter checks and tests

```
$ npm test
```

Walk through the examples from `/1_hello` incrementally.<br>
The first example is to familiarize with the environment, see a test failing and maybe implement it.<br>
The following examples are encouraging to look at specific code smells<br>
The last examples are designed to practice small steps to improve the code. 


## Warning: Spoilers ahead! :) 

Check the `refactored` git branch to look at one potential solution for the exercises.<br>
If you're practicing you should **not** check this branch first. Try solving the exercises on your own and only later refer to that as a possible solution.
